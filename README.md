- Working within a group colaborating on each others code such as explaining concepts or alternative solutions
- Managing each others code so propositions and queries were not overly used
- Selecting the best and worst Queries each member provided by comparing code to self set standard around the idea of clean code and functionality
- Managing everyone using group documantation as to keep track of where everyone was in terms of progress
